## IPAC
IPAC is a statistical approach that can adaptively incorporates relevant
annotations for prioritization of genetic risk variants, allowing nonlinear
effects among these annotations, such as interaction effects between genomic
features.

The proposed algorithm integrated both EM and gradient boosting.

Software is developed by Can Yang and Chao Yang.
